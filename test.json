The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).\n\nThe New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.\n\nThe network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.\n\nThe impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.\n\nThe authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.\n\t- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.\n\t- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.\n\t- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.\n\t- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.","opcode":"Info","type":"wineventlog","version":2,"tags":["winlogbeat","beats_input_codec_plain_applied"],"thread_id":74700,"@timestamp":"2019-04-04T11:49:16.305Z","task":"Logon","event_id":4624,"provider_guid":"{54849625-5478-4994-A5BA-3E3B0328C30D}","@version":"1","beat":{"hostname":"azad3-dc01","name":"azad3-dc01","version":"5.6.3"},"host":"azad3-dc01","fields":{"logtype":"dc_event"},"source_name":"Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"}
