Overview:
The program will take as input a filename, and produce as output a schema. Currently this is being built to scan and
parse JSON. The schema will follow this format:

key : dataType

For any nested data the format will be:

key : {
nestedKey1 : datatype
nestedKey2 : data Type
}

Plan:

Step 1: scan the file to confirm it meets the minimum requirements - Starts with { and ends with }. Ensure total of { is
equal to total of } to account for any nested elements.

Step 2: scan the file and generate token lexeme scan file. token
    2a. Tokens are { } , " : KEY VALUE
    2b. lexeme are the associated data { } , " computer_name string
    2c. Example:
        input: {"computer_name":"jrs_Comp",...}

        output:
            {   {
            "   "
            KEY computer_name
            "   "
            :   :
            "   "
            VALUES  jrs_Comp
            "   "
            ,   ,
            ...
Step 3: parse the scan file
